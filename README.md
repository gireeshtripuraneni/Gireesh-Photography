Photo Portfolio â€” Dark Theme
Generated: 2025-10-01T04:46:02.816015Z

Contents:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- assets/photos/photo1..photo8.svg (placeholder images)

How to run:
1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Install the "Live Server" extension (Ritwick Dey) for live reload.
3. Right click index.html -> Open with Live Server, or open index.html in a browser.
4. Replace the placeholder images in assets/photos/ with your optimized JPG/WEBP images.
   - Keep filenames or update paths in index.html accordingly.
   - For production, provide multiple sizes and update srcset attributes to point to <image>-800.jpg, <image>-1600.jpg, etc.
5. To swap placeholders with real Unsplash images, download them and put them into assets/photos/ then update srcset for responsive sizes.

Notes:
- The project uses GLightbox (via CDN) for fullscreen viewing and AOS for scroll animations.
- The provided images are SVG placeholders (no external network required).
- If you want real Unsplash images pre-downloaded into this ZIP, I can generate that next (will require web access to fetch photos).

Enjoy!
